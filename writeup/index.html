    <h1>Write Up</h1>
    <p>So far, we have developed a comprehensive outline for our website. We have a background/motivation page, a page explaining the measurements with animation, a page for interactive line plots of the various subjects, scenarios, and measurements, and a page with our conclusion, takeaways, and a supporting bar chart showing cumulative movement across various scenarios. We have used HTML, JS, and D3 to develop our plots and create interactive features such as selecting a subject and a scenario file. We have met as a group several times to distribute tasks and check-in. We hope to implement a scrollytelling format once we have finalized the contents of the project to make it more cohesive and easier to navigate and polish up with some animations. Additionally, we want to add the music that participants in the study interacted with (Mozart’s Jupiter) and have it playing in the background.

    <p>We believe the most challenging part of our project will be having our dynamic plots change with different filtering and selections by the user. We hope to include multiple scenarios and metrics. Making the axes and lines change to their new correct values hasn’t been straight forward. We also plan to make sure our cumulative statistics are accurate and clearly communicated. Another challenge we are anticipating is implementing the scrollytelling aspect. None of us are very familiar with scrollytelling so we have a lot to learn going forward.
