            For most people, good balance is often taken for granted– until it’s compromised. 
            Whether it’s getting out of bed, walking down the street, or simply standing still, 
            maintaining balance is a seamless part of daily life. Yet, for millions of individuals, 
            especially older adults or those with certain medical conditions, even these simple tasks 
            can become daunting challenges. Balance disorders are much more than mere inconveniences 
            and can increase the risk of falls, a leading cause of injury and even mortality. 
        </p>
        <p>But before we continue any further, let’s define balance.</p>

        <section class = "balance">
        <h2>What is Balance?</h2>
        <p>
            Balance is the ability to maintain the body’s center of mass over its base of support. 
            The <span class="term" data-definition="The labyrinth is a complex structure in the inner ear that 
            plays a crucial role in balance and hearing."> labyrinth</span> (inner ear), visual cues, and 
            somatosensory feedback from joints and tactile receptors all contribute to the balance system. A 
            properly functioning balance system allows an individual to see clearly while moving, identify 
            orientation, determine direction and speed of movement and make automatic postural adjustments to 
            maintain posture and stability. Any disruptions to these inputs can lead to feelings of instability 
            or a false sense of motion. This is otherwise known as vertigo or dizziness. 
    
        </p>
        <p>While balance is more often perceived as a relatively static state, it is actually a dynamic process 
            that involves constant adjustments to maintain stability. These adjustments, known as <span class="term"
            data-definition="Postural sway refers to the natural, continuous movement of the body to maintain balance.">
            postural sway</span>, help to counteract external forces like gravity or internal changes like muscle fatigue. 
        </p>
        <p>Postural sway is an integral part of balance control and it can reveal critical insights into how the 
            body intakes input sensory information to maintain equilibrium. 
        </p>
    
        <p>For instance, increased or irregular body sway may indicate that an individual is experiencing challenges 
            in processing input from their eyes, muscles/joints and ears, something that is often seen in people with 
            balance disorders. Studying these patterns can help researchers understand the mechanisms behind balance 
            and ways to improve stability.

        <section class="vr-therapy">
        <h2>Virtual Reality Therapy</h2>
        <p>
            One such solution innovatively utilizes Virtual Reality (VR) as a platform for rehabilitation. Not just a 
            tool for entertainment, VR has been used in clinical and rehabilitative contexts to simulate real-world 
            environments that could promote sway and disrupt balance. These treatments help vulnerable individuals to 
            develop strategies to help improve balance and avoid falling. Through personalized rehabilitation programs, 
            VR-exercises can help retrain the brain to better integrate sensory inputs and target specific weaknesses in 
            balance control. The use of VR for studying the role of vision in regulating body sway is well established, 
            however there has been less research done into how incorporating music can influence sway.
